We help startups launch startup stack in seconds:  landing page, blog, docs, forum, email marketing, live chat, feedback, authentication, storage, database, and more.



## What Cloudkoonly Is Not

Cloudkoonly is not a cloud vendor like AWS, we do not provide infrastructure services. 

We provide out-of-the-box startup tools, you only need a few clicks to quickly have your own online tools.



Cloudkoonly is not a traditional SaaS vendor. 

We offer three plans: Free Open Source,  Cloud Subscription,  and One-Time Build for You.

We hope to help startups choose the right plan at the right stage.

## Getting Started with Cloudkoonly 

Before you jump into using Cloudkoonly, it’s worth understanding a few key concepts to make your journey smoother.

Learn about servers, SSH access, and how Coolify manages your projects by checking out our [concepts guide ↗](/docs/get-started/concepts).

You have two ways to use Coolify:

- [Self-Host](https://coolify.io/docs/get-started/introduction#self-host-coolify)
- [Use Cloud](https://coolify.io/docs/get-started/introduction#use-coolify-cloud)
- [Build for You](https://coolify.io/docs/get-started/introduction#use-coolify-cloud)

------

### Self-Host

- Install Coolify on your own server. This requires setting up the server, installing Coolify, and handling updates yourself.
- You’ll also need to allocate some server resources to run Coolify.
- It’s completely free (except your server bills) and gives you full control over your infrastructure.

### Use Cloud

- Let the Coolify team manage Coolify for you.
- With Coolify Cloud, you don’t need to install or update Coolify yourself, and no server resources are required for Coolify itself, it runs on the Coolify team’s managed servers.
- Simply create an account from [here ↗](https://app.coolify.io/register), connect your servers via SSH keys, and start deploying. This is a paid service (starting at $5/mo), as it costs the team to host and maintain the infrastructure.
- Updates on Coolify Cloud are thoroughly tested by the core team, so they might be slightly delayed for added stability.

### Build for You

- One-time fee, no subscription
- One custom landing page
- Custom deployment
- One-to-one customer suppor
- Priority support (30 days)
